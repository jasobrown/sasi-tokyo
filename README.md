# sasi-tokyo
slide deck for SASI presentation in Tokyo

This preso uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for presentation in a web browser.
	
NOTE: in order to properly render this is a browser, you need to have [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) checked out in the parent directory. I know, I'm lazy and could have found a more elegant way to do it, but it wfm.
